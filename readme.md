#Tabs Manager

Sunday project to create a Chrome Extension that would use jQuery and Bootstrap v3

I decided to create an extension that allowed me to manage all my opened tabs in the different Chrome Windows. So I could click and drag the tabs to move them between existing windows and also create new windows.

This project also uses the [HTML5 Sortable](http://farhadi.ir/projects/html5sortable/) component for the dragging and dropping of tabs

Future work is to enable closing of tabs, and saving tabs in store for future use
